### My Plugins

I use **Awesome** default setup, minus set-tabline and air-line for more screen editing space. Below are listed my preffered plugins when editing with VIM.

#### General
**Ale** for linting, auto fixing and formatting files; **Supertab** for fastest completations; **Polyglot** for amazing syntax highlighting when editing files with LISP based languages. Using _Afterglow_, provided by **Awesome Colorschemes**, especially when working with Clojure.
#### Python
**Jedi** for documentation at buffer and quick suggestions; **Yapf** for auto fixing and **Flake8** for linting. Actually having some performance problems when saving files and inserting points before classes.
#### Clojure 
**Fireplace** for buffer documentation, logical analysis and **Leiningen REPL** integration. Finally, Tim Pope's **Salve** for automatic REPL run.
#### Latex 
**Vimtex** integrated with **LatexMK** for compiling and **Zathura**, my favorite document reader, for real time visualization.


> I would appreciate any suggestions of plugins for code/tex snippets, actually looking for one that improves and fits with my workflow.

## System
Before using Mint for almost one year, I moved to **Arch Linux** aiming at better performance and less installed packages. I'm still using Cinammon Desktop in rare situations, especially when can't correct some errors via window manager. **Awesome** and **i3-gaps** are my favorite managers, simple and efficient for what I want to do. **LARBS** provide the rest of the tools and configuration for my setup.
